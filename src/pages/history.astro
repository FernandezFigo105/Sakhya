            Ever since its inception, the College of Social Work, Nirmala
            Niketan, has emerged as a champion of human rights, believing that
            social work education and responding to the ground reality of human
            life must go hand in hand. During the 1980's when the “dowry”
            problem received much publicity as a source of violence and social
            injustice to women, the College readily responded to the invitation
            of the District Vigilance Commission, Govt. of Maharashtra, to
            participate in a concerted action against dowry violence on women.<br
            /> This Vigilance Cell initially worked under the Collector of Mumbai
            as Chairperson of the Committee. The Cell received funds from the Committee
            and submitted regular reports of its activities. However the official
            representatives on the Vigilance Cell were not able to give the attention
            required to approach the problem on a war-footing as was necessary for
            change in the system. Hence the college project of Sakhya was launched
            as the Anti-Dowry Guidance Cell of the District Vigilance Committee.
            Sakhya depended on the Committee for the funds to appoint professional
            social workers as well as to meet the expenses of the programmes planned
            by the College.<br /> The efforts made by the College under the banner
            of Sakhya had met with considerable success and new opportunities in
            the field of counselling as well as in recruiting volunteers to support
            the programmes organised, began to open in all directions. More personnel
            were needed to respond to expanding possibilities.

            While the Vigilance Committee continued to extend a certain measure
            of financial support to the project, the Sakhya workers felt the
            need of more competent professional members on the Vigilance Cell to
            guide their actions and programmes on the medical, legal and public
            relations aspects of their functioning. Moreover due to frequent
            changes in the appointment of Collectors, meetings were not held
            regularly and eventually the short-term as well as the long-term
            planning of the project became the responsibility of the
            Co-ordinator and Principal of the College. In 1994, the funding from
            the Vigilance Committee was suddenly curtailed with serious
            repercussions on the possibility of continuing the service of the
            professional social workers in the project. In the light of such
            vacillating support, Sakhya was obliged to seek other sources of
            financial help in order to sustain the vision and thrust of the
            project. Thus did Sakhya embark upon the second phase of the project
            which was marked by the following aspirations:

              <li>
                To broaden the vision of intervention to larger issues
                concerning women, beyond just the problem of dowry
              </li>
              <li>
                To effect a geographical expansion of services for a wider
                outreach to women
              </li>
              <li>
                To network with other organisations for a more effective
                intervention on the curative, preventive and promotional fronts
              </li>
              <li>
                To use media more effectively, to document and create greater
                awareness as a means of education of the public, to draw
                volunteers and to raise funds for the growing needs of the cause
                of women.

              (One would need to develop the various interventions and
              programmes of Sakhya during this second phase till the year 2004
              when Sakhya was no more a College project and became an
              independent entity under the Nirmala Institute Trust, with the
              change of address. You would have to show how Sakhya has developed
              gradually with increased staff and a widening and varied outreach
              with newer aspirations and goals. I was told to do only the first
              part which I have.)
